To correct:
our show page has error

To Do:
Ask user before we delete

Done:
1)  We have created Work Model
2)  We have created userprofileindex controller

Plan:
Create work and userprofile compartmentally and join them together in pages.index
We might rename pages.index to gallery.index


1) compile assets
2) add to index page
3) complete stuff


I cut the below from gallerycontroller


// $user_id = auth()->user()->id;      //For the post fetch user id
        // $user = User::find($user_id);       //For the user id fetch user data
        // $data = array(
        //     'response' =>'There Are No Galleries Yet',
        //     'posts'=> $user->posts,
        //     'galleries' => $user->galleries
        // );
        // return view('user.gallery.index')->with($data);
